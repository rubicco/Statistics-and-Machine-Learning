### [732A99](https://github.com/rubicco/Statistics-and-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Machine%20Learning) - Machine Learning / 2018Spring  
The course introduces the main concepts and tools in machine learning which are necessary for professional work and research in data analytics. The course presents machine learning mainly from a probabilistic framework, but successful non-probabilistic methods are also covered. Labs of this course is written in R.  
This course covers:  
-- Basic concepts in machine learning. Software. Regression, regularization and model selection.  
-- Classification methods. Dimensionality reduction and uncertainty estimation.  
-- Kernel methods and support vector machines. Neural networks and deep learning.  
-- Ensemble methods and mixture models. Online Learning.  
-- Splines and additive models. High-dimensional problems.
